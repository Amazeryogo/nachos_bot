This is the main development branch of the nachos bot, In this repo we add features that are usually unstabe and may not work. I advice you to not try this code on your bot as it is likely that it might not work.

## ROADMAP FOR THE NEAR FUTURE: <br/>
### 1)Add a censoring feature    <br/> (DONE)
### 2)A slotbot like feature     <br/>
### 3)MEMESSS!!!  <br/> (DONE)


Thats it for now, if you want to try the bot, here is the link
