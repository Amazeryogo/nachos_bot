This is the main development branch of the nachos bot, In this repo we add features that are usually unstabe and may not work. I advice you to not try this code on your bot as it is likely that it might not work.

ROADMAP FOR THE NEAR FUTURE:
1)Add a censoring feature
2)A slotbot like feature
3)MEMESSS!!! (I might add memes if i figure out how the reddit API works)


Thats it for now, if you want to try the bot, here is the link

anyways, hope you like the bot, if you have any advice or requests, you can contact nachosinmyyard#2905
